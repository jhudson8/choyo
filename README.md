# Choose your own adventure book engine

This is an web application that will allow you to present a choose your own adventure book.  It is intended to be used with the [book editor](http://jhudson8.github.io/choyo-editor) to create the stories.

I made this for my kid but thought I would share in case anyone else finds this useful.
